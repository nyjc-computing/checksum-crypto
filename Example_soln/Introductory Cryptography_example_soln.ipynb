    "\n",
    "In **asymmetric encryption**, the secret comes in two parts: the *private key* and the *public key*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipient creates a secret, and can share the **public key** freely; the **private key** must remain protected and accessible only to the recipient.\n",

    "Any sender who wishes to send a message to the recipient will encrypt it using the recipient's **public key**. The recipient then decodes the encrypted message using the **private key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public keys are only used for encrypting, and private keys are only used for decrypting. Because the keys for encryption and decryption are different, this is known as asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common asymmetric encryption algorithms in use today are AES, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymmetric encyrption algorithms are in general much more computationally expensive than symmetric encryption algorithms. As such, they are used only where security is critical (e.g. for authentication and authorisation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python packages on SSOE laptops do not have any modules for carrying out asymmetric encryption/decryption."
